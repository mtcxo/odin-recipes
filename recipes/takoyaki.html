        <h3>Description</h2>
        <p>
          **Takoyaki** is a popular Japanese street food made of small, round balls
          of savory batter filled with diced octopus (**tako**), green onions, and
          pickled ginger. Cooked in a special takoyaki pan with half-sphere molds,
          the balls are crisp on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Once
          cooked, they are typically topped with takoyaki sauce (similar to
          Worcestershire sauce), Japanese mayonnaise, bonito flakes (dried fish
          shavings), and aonori (seaweed flakes). Takoyaki is especially popular at
          festivals and night markets, loved for its rich umami flavor and
          satisfying texture.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green onions and
            make sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of oil, all
            your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve
            on. Heat up the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. Give
            the batter a whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the
            way up to the top. It’s okay if they overflow a bit. Add in the fillings
            and let cook until the edges start to look more solid and opaque.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don’t easily
            move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they’re at a 90° angle, pour
            in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. Let cook, stuffing in
            any excess batter that’s outside the ball, then turn again. You should
            have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, moving the
            balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is because most pans
            will have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to
            flip them.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and brush with
            takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo.
          </li>
