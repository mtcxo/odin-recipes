    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      **Takoyaki** is a popular Japanese street food made of small, round balls
      of savory batter filled with diced octopus (**tako**), green onions, and
      pickled ginger. Cooked in a special takoyaki pan with half-sphere molds,
      the balls are crisp on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Once
      cooked, they are typically topped with takoyaki sauce (similar to
      Worcestershire sauce), Japanese mayonnaise, bonito flakes (dried fish
      shavings), and aonori (seaweed flakes). Takoyaki is especially popular at
      festivals and night markets, loved for its rich umami flavor and
      satisfying texture.

      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Dashi powder</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Octopus</li>
      <li>Green onions</li>
      <li>Tenkasu</li>
      <li>Takoyaki sauce</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green onions and
        make sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of oil, all
        your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve
        on. Heat up the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. Give
        the batter a whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the
        way up to the top. It’s okay if they overflow a bit. Add in the fillings
        and let cook until the edges start to look more solid and opaque.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don’t easily
        move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they’re at a 90° angle, pour
        in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. Let cook, stuffing in
        any excess batter that’s outside the ball, then turn again. You should
        have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, moving the
        balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is because most pans
        will have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to
        flip them.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and brush with
        takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo.
      </li>
    </ol>
